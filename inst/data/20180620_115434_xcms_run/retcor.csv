"PEAKGROUPS","","This method performs retention time adjustment based on the alignment of chromatographic peak groups present in all/most samples (hence corresponding to house keeping compounds). First the retention time deviation of these peak groups is described by fitting either a polynomial (smooth = ""loess"") or a linear ( smooth = ""linear"") model to the data points. These models are subsequently used to adjust the retention time of each spectrum in each sample."
"minFraction","0.9","numeric(1) between 0 and 1 defining the minimum required fraction of samples in which peaks for the peak group were identified. Peak groups passing this criteria will aligned across samples and retention times of individual spectra will be adjusted based on this alignment. ForminFraction = 1 the peak group has to contain peaks in all samples of the experiment."
"extraPeaks","1","numeric(1) defining the maximal number of additional peaks for all samples to be assigned to a peak group (i.e. feature) for retention time correction. For a data set with 6 samples, extraPeaks = 1 uses all peak groups with a total peak count <= 6 + 1. The total peak count is the total number of peaks being assigned to a peak group and considers also multiple peaks within a sample being assigned to the group."
"smooth","loess","character defining the function to be used, to interpolate corrected retention times for all peak groups. Either ""loess"" or ""linear""."
"span","0.2","numeric(1) defining the degree of smoothing (if smooth = ""loess""). This parameter is passed to the internal call to loess."
"family","gaussian","character defining the method to be used for loess smoothing. Allowed values are ""gaussian"" and ""symmetric"".See loess for more information."
